# SQL Project: HR-Analytics Employee Attrittion & Performance

## Overview

_GreatPlaceToWork human resource personnel would like to improve performance, boost retention, and improve overall job satisfaction. However, they do not have good insights into the pertinent employee data. My goal is to analyze their data so I can provide recommendations to the HR department that will facilitate successful improvements._

## About the Data

Original data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudemadabdallah/hr-analytics-employee-attrition-and-performance/data?select=Employee.csv).

The dataset includes five tables, capturing information regarding performance reviews, employee demographics, satisfaction levels, and ratings.

## Exploration Questions

In this analysis, I help the HR department with the following:

### Performance Enhancement

1. Who are each department's top performers?

2. Analyze the affect of training on performance.

3. Is there a positive relationship between a good work-life balance and performance?

4. Are there correlations/discrepancies with employee self-assessments and manager evaluations in a given department?

5. Does a higher job satisfaction rating align with improved performance metrics?

### Retention and Turnover Insights

6. Are there any trends between low job satisfaction and attrition rates, specifically across a department or demographic?

7. Is there a relationship between overtime and turnover?

8. Does the distance from office seem to affect retention?

9. How are low relationship satisfaction scores with managers associated with attrition, especially in any specific departments?

10. Do employees who go longer without promotions have a higher tendency to leave?

### Boosting Job Satisfaction

11. Do employees who participate in more training opportunities report higher satisfaction in areas like work-life balance or job contentment?

12. Examine if frequent business travel has any negative impact on job satisfaction, work-life balance, or relationships at work.

13. How satisfied are employees who live further from the workplace than others?

14. Are there notable trends in satisfaction scores by gender, age, marital status, and other demographics?

15. How likely are employees who have been at the company longer to be satisfied with their job?

16. Does stock options seem to affect employee satisfaction?

### Managerial Effectiveness

17. Determine if a longer tenure with the same manager correlates with better job performance and satisfaction scores.

18. Do lower manager ratings contribute to higher attrition rates?

19. Which managers facilitate more training opportunities than others, and does this affect their employees' satisfaction and performance?

20. Examine if employees with longer relationships with their managers experience more frequent promotions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

BeforeData cleaning is essential to ensure the dataset is accurate and useful for further analysis. I did not find any data that needed to be standardized, so I only needed to perform simple checks for null values and duplicates.
