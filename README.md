# SQL Project: HR-Analytics Employee Attrittion & Performance

## Overview

_GreatPlaceToWork human resource personnel would like to improve performance, boost retention, and improve overall job satisfaction. However, they do not have good insights into the pertinent employee data. My goal is to analyze their data so I can provide recommendations to the HR department that will facilitate successful improvements._

## About the Data

Original data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudemadabdallah/hr-analytics-employee-attrition-and-performance/data?select=Employee.csv).

The dataset includes five tables, capturing information regarding performance reviews, employee demographics, satisfaction levels, and ratings.

## Exploration Questions

In this analysis, I help the HR department with the following:

### Performance Enhancement

1. Identifying High Performers by Department: Track employees with consistently high self and manager ratings across departments to pinpoint roles and factors linked to strong performance.

2. Evaluating Training Impact on Performance: Examine whether a higher count of completed training sessions correlates with improvements in performance ratings by managers.

3. Analyzing Work-Life Balance Influence: Investigate if there’s a positive relationship between higher work-life balance ratings and employee performance.

4. Alignment of Self and Manager Ratings: Analyze how employee self-assessments compare to manager evaluations, highlighting departments or demographics where discrepancies are frequent.

5. Job Satisfaction’s Link to Performance: Assess if higher job satisfaction ratings align with improved performance metrics, providing insights into the value of employee engagement.

### Retention and Turnover Insights

6. Attrition Patterns by Job Satisfaction: Identify trends between low job satisfaction and attrition rates, particularly across specific departments or demographics.

7. Examining Overtime and Attrition: Analyze the relationship between working overtime and the likelihood of employee turnover to spot potential risks.

8. Distance from Work and Turnover Correlation: Explore if a greater distance between home and work impacts an employee’s retention, especially when coupled with job dissatisfaction.

9. Retention Across Managerial Relationships: Determine if low relationship satisfaction scores with managers are associated with higher attrition, especially within specific teams.

10. Linking Promotion Delays to Attrition: Investigate if employees who go longer without promotions have a higher tendency to leave, which could indicate retention risks in career development.

### Boosting Job Satisfaction
11. Training’s Role in Job Satisfaction: Check if employees who participate in more training opportunities report higher satisfaction in areas like work-life balance or job contentment.

12. Job Satisfaction and Business Travel: Examine if frequent business travel has any negative impact on job satisfaction, work-life balance, or relationships at work.

13. Home-Work Distance and Satisfaction: Assess whether employees who live farther from the workplace report lower satisfaction in job or work-life balance, offering insights for flexible work policies.

14. Satisfaction Levels by Demographics: Break down satisfaction scores by gender, age, marital status, and other demographics to identify areas needing improvement.

15. Environment Satisfaction’s Impact on Overall Contentment: Study how satisfaction with the work environment relates to job satisfaction, performance, and retention, suggesting focus areas for improvement.

16. Stock Options and Job Satisfaction: Investigate if employees with higher stock options report greater job satisfaction or if stock ownership impacts turnover rates.

### Managerial Effectiveness

17. Impact of Manager-Employee Tenure on Performance: Determine if a longer tenure with the same manager correlates with better job performance and satisfaction scores.

18. Manager Ratings and Employee Retention: Assess if lower manager ratings contribute to higher attrition rates, with insights by department or manager tenure.

19. Training Access by Manager: Identify whether certain managers facilitate more training opportunities and if this support links to greater employee satisfaction and performance.

20. Influence of Manager-Employee Relationship on Promotion: Examine if employees with longer relationships with their managers experience more frequent promotions, and if this affects satisfaction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

BeforeData cleaning is essential to ensure the dataset is accurate and useful for further analysis. I did not find any data that needed to be standardized, so I only needed to perform simple checks for null values and duplicates.
